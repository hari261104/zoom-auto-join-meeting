# zoom-auto-join-meeting
This repository contains the tools and steps to automate zoom to automatically join a zoom meeting using CronTab

I'm new to python and shell, so if there are way I can learn to make the script any smaller or efficient, please do let me know.

Important note: I wrote this code with respect to a unix environment so it will mostly work for mac os/linux.

Please make sure to read the .pdf in zoom_auto completely and only after that to start working on it.

Also, make sure to edit "usr" in every commands with your username.

Thank you for using my scrpit
